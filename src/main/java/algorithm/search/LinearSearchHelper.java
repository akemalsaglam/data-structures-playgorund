/**
 * Linear search is a very simple search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(n).
 * In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one.
 * Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned,
 * otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
